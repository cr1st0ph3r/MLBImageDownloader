# MLBImageDownloader

Tool to download images from Mercadolibre in full resolution

The tool is self explanatory, just put the url in the field and if it is a valid MLB link 
it will then retrieve up to 10 images and then the user will have the choice of selecting
the ones to be saved.

Tis tool was made to fit our need to have a quick way to create new listings without having
to download the pictures one by one manually. there are currently websites that offer this
kind of service for free, therefore invalidating the need for this forms based application.
